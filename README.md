# Notice

I have no more plans to update or maintain this program because I discovered the following projects:

* [DHCR Rent Stabilized Data](https://github.com/clhenrick/dhcr-rent-stabilized-data) which got Excel spreadsheets straight from [DHCR](http://www.nyshcr.org/) and made a [beautiful map](https://chenrick.cartodb.com/viz/20b7c6ac-ee12-11e4-b74e-0e853d047bba/public_map)
* [NYC Stabilization Unit Counts](https://github.com/talos/nyc-stabilization-unit-counts) which is a massive PDF scraping project of NYC Tax Bills.

There is tremendous work done above. I'd like to mashup this data with others sometime.

# rgb2csv

This program is designed to take PDF files from the NYC Rent Guidelines Board (RGB) and extract the data into CSV files. PDFs lock in data, CSV frees data. 

I started this project to eventually map the data and discover where rent stabalized apartments are in NYC.

Currently, this program only works for the 2013 Manhattan data. The notice above explains why I've stopped working on this project.

# Thanks to

## NYC Rent Guidelines Board

Thank you for providing links to [Buildings That Contain Rent Stabalized Units](http://www.nycrgb.org/html/resources/zip.html)

## Tabula

Thank you for keeping [tabula-extractor](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula-extractor) open source so that anyone can free data locked away in PDF tables.
